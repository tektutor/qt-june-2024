## Multiple thread
<pre>
- Assume there are 3 gardeners
- Every day the forest department gives some saplings to plant
- The first gardener will dig a pit, let's call this person as digger
- The second gardener will plant the saplings with some compost. Let's call this person as planter
- The third gardener will fill the pit and water the sapling, let's call this person as filler
